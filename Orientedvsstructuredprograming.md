    <h1>What is the Difference Between Structured and Object Oriented Programming?</h1>
  <p>The <strong>main difference</strong> between structured and object oriented programming is that <strong>structured programming allows developing a program using a set of modules or functions, while object oriented programming allows constructing a program using a set of objects and their interactions.</strong></p>
    <p>A computer program is a set of instructions that instruct the CPU to perform a defined task. We can write computer programs using various programming languages. Furthermore, a programming paradigm is a way of categorizing a programming language depending on its features. Two such paradigms are structured and object oriented programming.

    <h2>What is Structured Programming?</h2>
    <p>Structured Programming divides a program into a set of functions or modules. <strong>Modular programming</strong> is another name for this. These functions have statements embraced inside curly braces. Each of these functions performs a subtask. Usually, as each function represents a specific functionality, it is easier for the programmer to test and debug the code, but this can differ depending on the program. C language and Pascal are two common structured programming languages.
