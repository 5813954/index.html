<title>What is the Difference Between Structured and Object Oriented Programming?</title> 
    <body>
  <p>The <strong>main difference</strong> between structured and object oriented programming is that <strong>structured programming allows developing a program using a set of modules or functions, while object oriented programming allows constructing a program using a set of objects and their interactions.</strong></p>
    <p>A computer program is a set of instructions that instruct the CPU to perform a defined task. We can write computer programs using various programming languages. Furthermore, a programming paradigm is a way of categorizing a programming language depending on its features. Two such paradigms are structured and object oriented programming.
