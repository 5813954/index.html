      <h1>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h1>
      <p>In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web
Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.</p>
      <p>On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG
2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose
either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive
guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the
WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.</p>
      <h2>WCAG 1.0</h2>
      <p>The WCAG 1.0 was published and became a W3C recommendation on 5 May 1999. They
have since been superseded by WCAG 2.0.</p>
      <p>WCAG 1.0 consists of 14 guidelines—each of which describes a general principle of
accessible design. Each guideline covers a basic theme of web accessibility and is
associated with one or more checkpoints that describe how to apply that guideline to
particular webpage features.<p/>
      <li>Guideline 1: Provide equivalent alternatives to auditory and visual content</li>
      <li>Guideline 2: Don’t rely on colour alone</li>
      <li>Guideline 3: Use markup and style sheets, and do so properly</li>
      <li>Guideline 4: Clarify natural language usage</li>
      <li>Guideline 5: Create tables that transform gracefully</li>
      <li>Guideline 6: Ensure that pages featuring new technologies transform gracefully</li>
      <li>Guideline 7: Ensure user control of time sensitive content changes</li>
      <li>Guideline 8: Ensure direct accessibility of embedded user interfaces</li>
      <li>Guideline 9: Design for device independence</li>
       <li>Guideline 10: User interim solutions</li>
       <li>Guideline 11: Use W3C technologies and guidelines</li>
       <li>Guideline 12: Provide context and orientation information</li>
       <li>Guideline 13: Provide clear navigation mechanisms</li>
